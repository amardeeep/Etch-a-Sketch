# Etch-a-Sketch
This is my first attempt at making this Etch-A-Sketch. I have added hover effect to squares that changes its color to black
and a button that asks user to input size of grid, which replaces the old grid with a new one with the mentioned dimensions.
I would add clear and eraser functions as well, is some time. Also a lot of fine tuneing is needed.
